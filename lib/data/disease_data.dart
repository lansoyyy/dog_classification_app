    'name': 'Bacterial Dermatosis',
    'advice':
        'Bacterial dermatosis in dogs is usually caused by an overgrowth of bacteria that naturally reside on the skin. Treatment often requires a course of antibiotics prescribed by your veterinarian. It is important to complete the full course of medication, even if your dog starts to show improvement. In addition to antibiotics, your vet may suggest medicated shampoos or topical ointments to manage the infection. Keeping the affected area clean and dry is essential to prevent the condition from worsening. Regular grooming and maintaining a healthy diet can help reduce the risk of future infections. If your dog has recurring bacterial infections, underlying causes such as allergies or hormonal imbalances may need to be investigated.'

    'name': 'Fungal Infections',
    'advice':
        'Fungal infections in dogs, such as ringworm or yeast infections, are common and can lead to itching, hair loss, and skin irritation. The treatment plan usually includes antifungal medications, which can be administered orally or topically, depending on the severity of the infection. It is important to isolate your dog during treatment, as some fungal infections like ringworm are contagious to both humans and other animals. Ensure that your dog’s environment is kept clean and dry, as moist conditions can exacerbate fungal growth. Disinfect your dog’s bedding and toys regularly. Fungal infections can take several weeks to clear up, so it’s crucial to follow your vet’s instructions carefully and complete the full course of treatment to prevent recurrence.'

    'name': 'Healthy',
    'advice':
        'A healthy dog’s skin should be smooth, free from redness, lumps, or scaling, and their coat should be shiny and soft. Maintaining this level of health requires regular grooming to remove loose fur and dirt, which can help prevent skin problems. A balanced diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids and high-quality proteins is essential for skin and coat health. Regular checkups with your veterinarian will help monitor any early signs of skin conditions or other health issues. Additionally, keeping your dog free from parasites such as fleas and ticks is crucial, as these pests can irritate the skin and cause infections. Ensure that your dog stays hydrated and provide plenty of exercise to support overall health, which will reflect in the skin and coat.'

    'name': 'Hypersensitivity Allergic Dermatosis',
    'advice':
        'Hypersensitivity allergic dermatosis, often caused by food allergies, environmental factors, or flea bites, leads to chronic itching, inflammation, and irritation of the skin. Managing this condition starts with identifying the specific allergen triggering your dog’s symptoms. Your veterinarian may recommend allergy testing or elimination diets to pinpoint food-related allergies. Antihistamines, corticosteroids, or even immunotherapy may be prescribed to control the allergic response. It’s important to keep your dog’s living area clean and free from potential allergens such as dust mites, pollen, or mold. Regular flea control is also critical, as flea saliva is a common trigger for allergic reactions. In some cases, a hypoallergenic diet or supplements like omega-3 fatty acids may help reduce skin inflammation. Managing this condition requires long-term care and regular vet consultations to adjust treatment as needed.'
